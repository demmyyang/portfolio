                    <b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</b> An in-depth exploration of air travel processes. Over-it proposes a solution to the drudgery of layover flights.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>BACKGROUND:</b> Recently, airlines have been following a trend of fewer non-stop flight options and more layovers. Oftentimes, travelers may have a hard time finding low-cost direct flights without one or more layovers during their booking process. For some travelers, layovers are unavoidable and daunting. They can range anywhere from one hour to several hours. On the other hand, some travelers may purposely book their flights with longer layovers or even a stopover so that they can explore the surrounding area before moving on to their next checkpoint. Whatever the purpose of a layover may be, there are some unique issues that travelers may have to consider while booking their flight(s) and at the airport. 
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>GOALS:</b> to explore the impact of layovers and/or stopovers on the planning process and travel experience in order to find solutions for unique issues that travelers may run into while booking their trip and at the airport.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</b><br />
                    - What is the end-to-end process of how participants have made past travel decisions?<br />
                    - What inconveniences have the participants faced during the booking process and duration of their last trip?<br />
                    - What considerations have participants needed to make in regards to layovers while booking/ planning their past travel itineraries?<br />
                    - Understanding who is more likely to rely on short-term baggage storage during their trip.<br />
                    - What have participants relied on in the past to pass time during their layover and what could improve their layover experience in the future?

                    <br /><br />
                    <b>TOOLS USED:</b> Figma, Miro, Trello, Zoom, Google Forms, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop<br />
